                    <h5> Features </h5>
                    <p>
                        Typically, the factors that coaches and captains will consider
                        when deciding if they will hold practice are:
                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Windspeed and maximum wind gusts.</b> Is the wind too
                                strong? Will it be safe to send boats out and still
                                sail safely? Alternatively, is there enough wind to
                                sail at all?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Wind direction.</b> Wind from the North is denser
                                and colder than wind from the south, so practice might be cancelled
                                at windspeeds from the North that are sailable from the South.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Air temperature. </b> Cold conditions can make it
                                simply too dangerous to sail. Schools in areas that
                                experience winter will cancel practice for all of the
                                winter season, but may also need to consider one-off days
                                that are also too cold.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b> Visibility. </b> When it is too cloudy, it is
                                unsafe to sail away from shore. A small amount of
                                fog is not unsafe, but if it gets to a point where
                                the sailor can no longer see shore, they may be
                                in danger of getting lost, in which case practice
                                must be cancelled.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b> Precipitation. </b> While it is not unsafe to sail
                                in the rain, precipitation can sometimes indicate
                                whether or not practice should be held. Depending on the
                                air temperature, it might be okay to sail without
                                getting wet, but could be unsafe and too cold if
                                it is raining.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b> Storm Status. </b> Although precipitation would
                                not on its own prevent the team from practicing,
                                thunderstorms make sailing entirely dangerous, and
                                practice should be cancelled any time a thunderstorm
                                is in the area.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        In addition to these weather considerations, whether or not
                        a coach feels safe running practice may vary from person to person.
                        I collected all the above data to train my model for practice days
                        from Spring 2015 to May 2018, including who was coaching each
                        day and whether or not the team had an <b> On The Water </b>
                        practice or a <b> Chalk Talk </b>, which is the term used for
                        an on-land sailing discussion.
                    </p>
                    <h5> Data Sources </h5>
                    <p>
                        The data was acquired from three different sources.
                        The coaching and practice data was acquired from the NU
                        Sailing Team practice records. These are dated from March of 2015
                        to May of 2018, for a total of 198 records. The windspeed,
                        air temperature, and wind direction data was scraped for each
                        date from the <a href="https://www.glerl.noaa.gov//metdata/chi/">Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory
                        archives</a>, while the visiblity and precipitation data was
                        scraped from <a href="https://www.wunderground.com"> Wunderground.com's </a>
                        data archives. Finally, storm status was manually collected
                        from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/evanston/historic">
                        timeanddate.com's </a> Evanston history. A python script was used
                        to collect all this data into a .arff file appropriate for Weka.
                    </p>
                    <p> The python script can be <a class="pagelinks" href="downloadable_files/weather_data_collection.py"
                        download = "weather_data_collection.py">
                        downloaded here. </a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The .arff file produced from this script
                        and used in Weka training can be <a class="pagelinks" href="downloadable_files/nustdata.arff"
                        download = "nustdata.arff"> downloaded here. </a>
                    </p>
                    <h5> Model Training and Results </h5>
                    <p> After experimenting with many different Weka models informally,
                        the Logistic, Perceptron, J48, and Random Forest models
                        were those that performed notably better than ZeroR, which
                        had a percent accuracy of <b>80.3030 %</b>. For these models,
                        I removed certain features that might have been less important.
                        After comparing percent accuracies for different combinations
                        of features, the Random Forest model with the features: <i>
                        Windspeed, Wind gust, Wind direction, Visibility, Precipitation, and
                        Storm Status </i> was the most accurate, with a percent accuracy
                        of <b>90.4040 %</b> as seen in the table below.
                    <p>

                        </table>
                    </p>

                    <p> That the model was able to improve by 10 percent over such a high ZeroR
                        indicates that a predictive model is useful and feasible to determine
                        whether or not the conditions allow for sailing. Despite this,
                        I believe the model could be greatly benefitted by more data. Because
                        the data available was only limited to the past four years, the amount
                        of data was enough to train a crude model, but more data would definitely
                        help to refine this model.
                    </p>
                    <p> It makes sense that the Random Forest performed so well, because
                        even from a human perspective, choosing whether or not to hold practices
                        operates simlarly to a decision tree. Certain features, such as
                        windspeed are the most definitive factors, but certain factors can
                        make or break a practice.
                    </p>


                    <h5> Future Work </h5>
                    <p>
                        As previously mentioned in order to expand this model to more accurately and
                        predict whether or not a team should go sailing, first and foremost
                        more data is necessary. Practice Records for the Northwestern University Sailing
                        Team only go back to the Spring of 2015. In order for meaningful
                        analysis to be done, team leaders will need to continue to dutifully record
                        data. In some cases, chalk talks have been favored over On The Water
                        practices when a coach was injured during activites outside
                        of practice. At the beginning of the year, practices were
                        assigned as chalk talks to educate new team members and go through
                        safety and onboarding trainings. These examples are independent
                        of the conditions, and, without record of these chalk talks and
                        their reasons, the model cannot be accurately trained.

                        Beyond the NU sailing team, it could be useful to collect data
                        from other locations and other schools. While different teams may have
                        different abilities, similar teams could be matched to expand the
                        database of practice records. One of the challenges here is that
                        teams are often student run and do not keep thorough records of
                        their practices.

                        Finally, this data could be used to actually create a practice
                        predictor or advisor. It would be useful for coaches and captains
                        to seek "advice" from past practices, and use their own decisions,
                        as well as those who came before them, as precident.

                    <h5> Concluding Thoughts </h5>
                    <p>
                        Overall, it was interesting to work on this project and see how
                        something that I focus a lot of my extra-curricular time on
                        could be predicted and enhanced by machine learning techniques.
                        It is easy to see that with enough data, Machine Learning techniques
                        can, at the very least, help humans make more informed decisions.
                        Even if machine learning models don't replace human decision
                        making, they can act to enhance human cognition.
                    </p>
                    <p> The lack of data over time also provided a motivation for
                        taking and storing data well. While machine learning techniques
                        may change and advance to better suit more specific applicaitons,
                        without the data they cannot be used to their full potential.
                        Data collection and management becomes the foundation of
                        future machine learning applications.
